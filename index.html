      <h1>What is VRP?</h1>
      <p class="aside">
        An exec summary by <a href="https://stateless.group/">Stateless Group</a>,
        the consultancy who led Open Banking's delivery of the world's
        first VRP Standard.

      <p>
        Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs) are a new addition to Open
        Banking that allow a customer to safely connect services to their
        bank account so that those services can make instant bank
        transfers automatically on their behalf.
      </p>

      <p>
        VRPs are an alternative method to card payments that are safer and
        more efficient. They enable innovation in payment UX, reduction in
        processing fees, better control of risk, faster settlement, and
        the creation of new types of services for customers involving
        the intelligent programmatic movement of their money.
      </p>

      <p>Some examples of where VRP will improve over card payments:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Automatic bill payments</li>
        <li>“One click” payments</li>
        <li>Frictionless payments at the point of sale</li>
        <li>Automated savings and financial management (“Sweeping”)</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>How does VRP work?</h1>
      <p>
        Put simply, VRP entails a customer leaving permission
        (“<strong>Consent</strong>”) with their bank for a third party
        service to be able to make bank transfers, in the background, on
        their behalf.
      </p>

      <p>There are 5 key steps to the VRP process:</p>

      <h2>Step 1 - Agreeing consent</h2>
      <p>
        Setting up a VRP begins by the customer agreeing with the service
        provider under what conditions they agree for payments to be made
        on their behalf. Those conditions restrict things
        like the destination accounts they can send to, the amounts they
        are able to move, the frequency with which payments can be made,
        the date the permission expires, etc. In VRP, we call those
        conditions “<strong>Consent Parameters</strong>”.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2 - Redirection to bank app</h2>
      <p>
        Once agreed, the service provider refers the customer to their
        bank app with this consent information, so that the bank can
        know under what conditions they should honour payment
        instructions from the service provider for that customer.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3 - Strong Customer Authentication with bank</h2>
      <p>
        The bank displays the details of the consent to the customer and
        securely authenticates them, confirming the customer agrees. The
        bank records the agreed consent and creates an associated
        <strong>access token</strong> for the service provider. The bank
        then refers the customer back to the service provider with that
        access token.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4 - Redirection back to service provider app</h2>
      <p>
        The customer delivers the access token to the service provider,
        which is then stored against the customer’s account for later
        use. At this point, the “<strong>VRP consent setup</strong>” has
        been completed.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 5 - Ongoing VRP Payments</h2>
      <p>
        From now on, the service provider can use the access token to
        instruct transfers from the customer’s account on their behalf
        (“<strong>VRP Payments</strong>”), provided the usage is within
        the conditions of the agreed consent parameters. If the service
        provider attempts to make a payment that would violate those
        conditions in any way, the bank will reject the service
        provider’s instruction.

      <h1>Will my business be affected by VRP?</h1>
      <p>
        VRP will be an unprecedented step change to the payments
        landscape that will impact many businesses including retailers,
        payments companies, fintechs, and banks.
